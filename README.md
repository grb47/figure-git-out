Trying to understand this stuff

I mean, this kind of makes sense. I understand
the basics of it, and I'm pretty sure that when
I get rolling it'll be easy as pie. But for now,
it's a little overwhelming.

They say that if you're never overwhelmed you're
never learning. If I want to be a strong programmer,
I have to excel with git. There is no way around that.
